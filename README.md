# Search Functionality

### Search Bar Behavior:
 When a search query is entered into the search bar, the product list is refreshed to display results matching the query. This process triggers a reload of the product list to show only items that match the search criteria, replacing the currently displayed products (which are fetched in batches of 4).

### Expanded Product List on Search: 
As you start typing a search query, the entire product catalog is retrieved and displayed, allowing for a comprehensive search experience. This means that any previously visible products will be replaced with search results, and you will see all products that match your search terms. If you want to view additional products, you can scroll to load more products or type in the search bar to load all products.
